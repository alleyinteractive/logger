### Grunt Tasks

This directory should contain named files to match the grunt tasks you are calling. In most cases this will be a simple JSON file, but sometimes you'll need to use a small module. See https://github.com/firstandthird/load-grunt-config for more information about writing grunt task files. `aliases.json` contains the actual grunt tasks eg `grunt lint` or `grunt build`.
